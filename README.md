**# CompressorDecompressor**
A compressor decompressor program on java swing is a software application that can reduce the size of files by applying compression techniques and restore them to their original form by applying decompression techniques.

**GZIP File Compression and Decompression Java Swing Project**
**Introduction**
This Java Swing project aims to provide a user-friendly interface for compressing and decompressing files using the GZIP compression algorithm. GZIP is a popular data compression format widely used to reduce the size of files.

**Features**
**File Compression:** Easily compress files using the GZIP algorithm.
**File Decompression:** Decompress GZIP compressed files with a simple click.
**User-Friendly Interface:** Intuitive and easy-to-use Swing GUI for smooth interactions.
**Progress Monitoring:** Monitor the progress of compression and decompression processes.

**Usage**
**Compression:**
Click on the "Compress" button.
Select the file you want to compress.
The compressed file will be saved in the same location with a .gz extension.

**Decompression:**
Click on the "Decompress" button.
Choose the GZIP compressed file you want to decompress.
The decompressed file will be saved in the same location without the .gz extension.
